## Features

- Classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam
- Uses TF-IDF for feature extraction
- Uses Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification
- Text preprocessing includes tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming
- Streamlit-based web app for easy interaction
- Supports direct user input and example messages
